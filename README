# Whack-a-Mole Game 🎯 
A simple **Whack-a-Mole** browser game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This was created as part of my learning journey to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.

## How to Play 🎮 
- Moles randomly pop up from different holes. 
- Click the mole as fast as you can to score points before it disappears. 
- The game runs for a set time — try to get the highest score!
